We leveraged Bayesian optimization (BO) to search for potential high-performing catalysts. Our BO workflow can be initialized with as few as 2 to 8 data points, and often identifies the optimal single-atom alloy surface in just a few iterations. For applications, we used BO to identify potential high-performing catalysts for alkane transformations, CO2 reduction, and hydrogen evolution.
