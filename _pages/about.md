# Gbolade Kayode (Kay)
Kay obtained his bachelorâ€™s degree with first-class honors in chemical engineering from Covenant University. He also obtained his Ph.D. in Chemical & Biomolecular  engineering under the guidance of [Prof. Matthew Montemore at Tulane University](https://www.montemoregroup.org/). His primary research fell under the broad area of computational chemistry, where he used quantum mechanical simulations, high-performance computing, and machine learning to accelerate the discovery of materials for energy purposes. Furthermore, he is the recipient of the Apex Scholar Award from NSBE and so many other awards. Kay recently received an Award from the Connolly Alexander Institute for Data Science for one of his [projects](https://gkayode.com/projects/), where he used bayesian optimization to disover high-performing catalytic materials. Kay also has datascience experience in other domains which includes finance, marketing (non-profit).
